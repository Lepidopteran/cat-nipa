# Cat NIPA

A tool made for the purpose of messing with Nitro+'s NPA archives.

Pseudo alternative to [nipa](https://github.com/Wilhansen/nipa) made in Rust.

Currently in the experimental phase.

The primary focus is on extracting files from NPA archives.
Depending on user interest and demand, future updates may include support for creating NPA archives.
